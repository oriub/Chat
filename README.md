# Chat
Chat (such an original name, I know), is a simple real-time chat application website. 
The frontend is written in React (using the next.js pages router and typescript) and the backend is written using FastAPI (with an SQLModel database).
This chat can also be used as a ground control station to a drone using my [DroneChatManager](https://github.com/oriub/DroneChatManager) repository
